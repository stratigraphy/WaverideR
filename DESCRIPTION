Description: WaverideR is an R package for advanced cyclostratigraphic 
 analysis of stratigraphic data sets. It provides a comprehensive suite 
 of spectral tools for detecting, visualising, and tracking non-stationary 
 astronomical cycles, including continuous wavelet transforms (CWT), the 
 superlet transform, windowed FFT, and evolutionary harmonic analysis (EHA) (wrapper). 
 These methods allow both manual and automated tracking of orbital cycles in spectra 
 and scalograms, even in records affected by large changes in sedimentation rate. 
 Building on this spectral framework, WaverideR supports multi-proxy integration and 
 Monte Carlo–based uncertainty propagation to construct statistically robust floating 
 and absolute astrochronological age models. The package includes dedicated tools to 
 quantify analytical wavelet uncertainty, estimate the duration of stratigraphic gaps 
 and hiatuses, and integrate external radioisotopic age constraints. Designed for
 complex and incomplete stratigraphic records, WaverideR enables investigation of 
 the imprint of astronomical forcing even in suboptimal datasets.
 The 'WaverideR' package builds upon existing literature and established
 code bases. Relevant references can be grouped into four main subjects:
 cyclostratigraphic data analysis, example data sets, the continuous
 wavelet transform, and astronomical solutions.
