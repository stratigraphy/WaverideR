Description: The continuous wavelet transform enables the observation of transient/non-stationary cyclicity in time-series. The goal of cyclcostratigraphic studies is to define frequency/period in the depth/time domain. By conducting the continuous wavelet transform on cyclostratigraphic data series one can observe and extract cyclic signals/signatures from signals. These results can then be visualized and interpreted enabling one to identify/interpret cyclicity in the geological record, which can be used to construct astrochronological age-models and identify and interpret cyclicity in past en present climate systems.
