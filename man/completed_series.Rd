\title{Complete the tracking of cycle in a wavelet spectra}
\usage{
completed_series(
  wavelet = NULL,
  tracked_curve = NULL,
  period_up = 1.2,
  period_down = 0.8,
  extrapolate = TRUE,
  genplot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{wavelet}{Wavelet object created using the \code{\link{analyze_wavelet}} function.}

\item{tracked_curve}{Traced period result from the \code{track_period_wavelet} function.}

\item{period_up}{The upper period parameter is a factor of the to be completed curve \code{Default=1.2},
which puts a limit on how far the code{\link{completed_series}} function can "look up" to find the next spectral peak.
if no spectral peak is found data is interpolated between spectral peaks.}

\item{period_down}{The lower period parameter is a factor of the to be completer curve \code{Default=0.8},
, #'which puts a limit on how far the code{\link{completed_series}} function can "look down" to find the next spectral peak.
if no spectral peak is found data is interpolated between spectral peaks.}

\item{extrapolate}{Extrapolate the completed curve when through parts where no spectral peaks could be traced
\code{Default=TRUE}.}

\item{genplot}{Generate a plot \code{Default=TRUE}. The red curve is the completed curve,
the black curve is the original curve.}

\value{
Returns a matrix with 2 columns
The first column is the depth axis
The second column is the completed tracking of the period a cycle of the wavelet spectra
}
\description{
Use the traced series and the existing wavelet
spectra to complete the tracking of a cycle of the wavelet spectra.
The selected points using the \code{\link{track_period_wavelet}} function form a incomplete line
unless every point is tracked. However clicking every individual point along a wavelet ridge is time
intensive and error prone.
To avoid errors and save time the \code{\link{completed_series}} function can be used to
complete the tracing of a cycle in a wavelet spectra.The \code{\link{completed_series}} function interpolates the
data points selected using the \code{\link{track_period_wavelet}}. A a search a algorithm then looks up and replaces
the interpolated curve values with the values of the nearest spectral peak in the wavelet spectra.
