\usage{
analyze_Awavelet(
  data = NULL,
  dj = 1/100,
  lowerPeriod = 2,
  upperPeriod = 1024,
  verbose = FALSE,
  omega_min = 6,
  omega_max = 12,
  scaling = "log2",
  alpha = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Input data, should be a matrix or data frame in which
the first column is depth or time and the second column is the proxy record.}

\item{dj}{Spacing between successive scales. Scales increase by powers
of two as \code{2^(j * dj)}. Smaller values of \code{dj} increase
frequency resolution at the expense of computational time.
Default is \code{1/100}.}

\item{lowerPeriod}{Lowest period to be analysed. Defines the smallest
scale of the transform.}

\item{upperPeriod}{Highest period to be analysed. Defines the largest
scale of the transform.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, print interpolation diagnostics.}

\item{omega_min}{Minimum number of oscillatory cycles of the Morlet
wavelet.}

\item{omega_max}{Maximum number of oscillatory cycles of the Morlet
wavelet.}

\item{scaling}{Character string defining how the number of wavelet
cycles varies with scale. One of
\code{"log2"}, \code{"linear"}, \code{"sqrt"}, \code{"quadratic"},
or \code{"power"}.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric. Exponent used when \code{scaling = "power"}.
Values greater than one emphasize high frequency sharpening, whereas
values smaller than one emphasize low frequency sharpening.}

\item{n_simulations}{Number of Monte Carlo simulations. Currently
included for interface compatibility.}

\item{run_multicore}{Logical. Currently included for interface
compatibility.}

\description{
Compute the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) using a complex Morlet
wavelet with scale dependent wavelet width. The number of oscillatory
cycles in the Morlet wavelet is allowed to vary smoothly with scale,
enabling adaptive time frequency resolution similar in spirit to
superlet based approaches.
