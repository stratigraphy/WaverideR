\title{Extract signal from a wavelet spectra using a traced period curve}
\usage{
extract_signal(
  tracked_cycle_curve = NULL,
  wavelet = NULL,
  period_up = 1.2,
  period_down = 0.8,
  add_mean = TRUE,
  tracked_cycle_period = NULL,
  extract_cycle = NULL,
  tune = FALSE,
  plot_residual = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tracked_cycle_curve}{Traced period result from the \code{track_period_wavelet}
function completed using the \code{completed_series}.
The input can be pre-smoothed using the the \code{loess_auto} function.}

\item{wavelet}{wavelet object created using the \code{\link{analyze_wavelet}} function.}

\item{period_up}{Upper period as a factor of the to be extracted cycle \code{Default=1.2}.}

\item{period_down}{Lower period as a factor of the to be extracted cycle \code{Default=0.8}.}

\item{add_mean}{Add mean to the extracted cycle \code{Default=TRUE}.}

\item{tracked_cycle_period}{Period in time of the traced cycle.}

\item{extract_cycle}{Period of the to be extracted cycle.}

\item{tune}{Convert record from the depth to the time domain using the traced period \code{Default=FALSE}.}

\item{plot_residual}{Plot the residual signal after extraction of set cycle \code{Default=FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix with 2 columns
The first column is depth/time
The second column is extracted signal
}
\description{
Extract signal power from the wavelet in the depth domain using the traced period.
