\title{XRF records of the Bisciaro Fm}
\description{
data set consist of the tie points between the Bisciaro_al record
of Arts (2014) and the la2011 solution of laskar et al., (20111)\cr
}
\details{
The data set is a matrix with the 4 columns.
The first column is the depth/time of the al proxy record tie-points.
The second column is the time value of the la2011 astronomical solution tie-points.
