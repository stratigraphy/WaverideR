# WaverideR

The 'Waverider' R package uses the continuous wavelet transform to analyze cyclostratigraphic data.
The continuous wavelet transform enables the observation of transient/non-stationary
cyclicity in time-series. The goal of cyclostratigraphic studies is to define frequency/period
in the depth/time domain. By conducting the continuous wavelet transform on cyclostratigraphic
data series one can observe and extract cyclic signals/signatures from signals.
These results can then be visualized and interpreted enabling one to identify/interpret
cyclicity in the geological record, which can be used to construct astrochronological
age-models and identify and interpret cyclicity in past en present climate systems.

## Installation
